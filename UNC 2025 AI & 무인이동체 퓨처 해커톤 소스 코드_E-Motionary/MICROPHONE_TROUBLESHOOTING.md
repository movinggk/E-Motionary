# üé§ Microphone Access Troubleshooting Guide

If you're experiencing "Could not access microphone" errors, follow this step-by-step guide to resolve the issue.

## Quick Fixes (Try These First)

### 1. Browser Permissions
**Chrome/Edge:**
- Click the lock icon üîí in the address bar
- Click "Site Settings"
- Find "Microphone" and set to "Allow"

**Firefox:**
- Click the shield icon üõ°Ô∏è in the address bar

- Set "Microphone" to "Allow"

**Safari:**
- Safari ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Websites ‚Üí Microphone

### 2. HTTPS Requirement
Microphone access requires HTTPS or localhost. Make sure you're accessing the app via:
- ‚úÖ `http://localhost:3000` (development)
- ‚úÖ `https://yourdomain.com` (production)
- ‚ùå `http://yourdomain.com` (will not work)

### 3. Browser Compatibility
Use modern browsers:
- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+
- ‚úÖ Safari 11+
- ‚ùå Internet Explorer (not supported)

### 3.5. Audio Settings Compatibility
The app now automatically tries multiple audio configurations:
- **Most Compatible**: Just `{ audio: true }` (like working audd.py)
- **Basic**: `{ audio: {} }` (no constraints)
- **Enhanced**: With echo cancellation and noise suppression
- **Standard**: 44.1kHz, stereo, with audio processing

The app now uses the exact same audio configuration as your working `audd.py` file as the first option, ensuring maximum compatibility.
